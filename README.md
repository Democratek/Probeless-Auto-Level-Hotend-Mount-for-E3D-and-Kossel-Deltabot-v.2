Probeless-Auto-Level-Hotend-Mount-for-E3D-and-Kossel-Deltabot-v.2
=================================================================
This is an improvement of my first design posted to thingiverse: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:277083
I utilized and modified designes from Johan Rocholl (https://github.com/jcrocholl/kossel/blob/master/effector.scad) and 
tjb1 (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:57889)

This version is more robust, less cobbled together, and more reliable.

It requires only the listed printed parts, homemade or purchased set screws close to 3mm (I made my own from brass screws for better conductivity and corrosion resistance), some 3mm bolts, pen springs, and some cat 5 or similar wire.

It is designed to fit an E3D hotend, but will probably fit j-head hotends as well.
